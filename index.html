        <p>Batman, one of the most iconic superheroes, was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, first appearing in "Detective Comics" #27 in 1939. Known for his dark persona and lack of superpowers, Batman is the alter ego of billionaire Bruce Wayne, who fights crime in Gotham City. The character has been adapted into numerous films, starting with the 1966 movie featuring Adam West. The 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, starring Michael Keaton, marked a darker and more gothic portrayal. Christopher Nolan's "Dark Knight" trilogy (2005-2012) with Christian Bale is highly acclaimed for its realistic tone. Ben Affleck and Robert Pattinson have also donned the cape, each bringing unique interpretations to the role. Batman's cinematic journey reflects the character's evolution, from campy to gritty, resonating with audiences across generations.</p>
